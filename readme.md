Broodwar Loader
===============

Broodwar loader was a GUI dll injection tool I wrote to inject my own game hacks into Broodwar. This hack injector was widely used and can still be found on various Broodwar hacking forums. This hack was well known for continuing to work on Windows 98, XP and then into Vista when it came out. It worked because of my injection method that I chose, which I cannot remember enough about now days to brag about, but it was considered the more difficult approach of the time! :P
